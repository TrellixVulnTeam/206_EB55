I finished my last quarter ever at North Seattle College this past Friday and I drove down to Portland on Saturday and then I drove down to San Francisco on Sunday! I don't have any fancy internship, but I kind of have a person down here that I like a lot, so I am having a fun time. I am currently applying to restaurant jobs and will probably be working by the end of this week.\n\nAt the end of the summer I am driving from SF to Ann Arbor with my brother Kevin (lolol) to start school at UMich. I am so so excited for this summer and to start school this fall! And I want to give a big ol' shout out to my parents Kim Buczek Essenmacher and Brian Essenmacher. They have been super supportive, and I would not have this amazing opportunity without them. My dad flew across the country and worked on my car on Fathers Day weekend, which is mind-bogglingly kind. And even though I sometimes get annoyed when my mom has the audacity to ask me about logistics of my crazy plans, such as driving from one corner to the US to another I appreciate her insights since she always has my best interest. \n\nSo if you're in the SF Bay Area this summer gimme a holler and we can get lost on the public transportation together!
