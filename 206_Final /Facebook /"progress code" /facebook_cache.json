I have spent the last year stressing out about internships since a great number of my peers have been getting bomb ass internships across the globe.

BUT the catch is that it is an internship for the fall and I am going to be attending U of M so I am not able to accept it. \n\nBut for those of you that don't know, I drove down to San Francisco this summer to have a good time and to spend some time with Jared- who I have been dating for about 9ish months (I think it's okay to tag ya in a post now lol). I have only been in SF for ~4 weeks and I have been to 5 or 6 different events/summits/meetups. I will be driving from Cali to Michigan with my brother around August 18th. \n\nI came to SF not really knowing anyone besides Jared and his roommates, but I somehow got a job on the 5th day I was in the city after some hustling on the good ol' Linkedin and other job sites. Aaaaand it's another one of Kyle's weird jobs. My summer job this year is at a Korean Bibimbop restaurant. Which is essentially a Korean Chipotle. It is located in an international food court in the downtown financial district. Which I was a little bummed about at first- but since it is located where a bunch of fancy business people work AND eat lunch I am able to talk to them when they order food; so I have actually been able to make some valuable contacts with people in the same field I am-- while I am asking them if they would like noodles, rice or lettuce for their bowl of course. \n\nBut I'm excited (and a lil nervous) to see what my future holds in Ann Arbor this coming fall, and to see my Michigan people! \n\nThat's all I got for my Facebook update this time!", "created_time": "2017-07-14T17:50:36+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209731024459385", "status_type": "mobile_status_update", "created_time": "2017-07-12T00:11:23+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209712268310493", "status_type": "added_photos", "message": "Idk when it happened, but now I collect pins", "created_time": "2017-07-09T20:21:38+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209687379168280", "status_type": "added_photos", "message": "I have now experienced being squished next to an Asian woman half my size on a public train car", "created_time": "2017-07-07T01:55:52+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209664242429876", "status_type": "added_photos", "message": "One of the rare moments Yesi sat still for a pic", "created_time": "2017-07-04T23:04:15+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209652909906570", "status_type": "shared_story", "created_time": "2017-07-03T21:15:30+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209621120511855", "status_type": "added_photos", "created_time": "2017-07-01T04:57:13+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10207710427265718", "created_time": "2017-06-30T19:00:00+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209236553177912", "created_time": "2017-06-30T19:00:00+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209599266765525", "status_type": "mobile_status_update", "message": "My time in SF so far in 7 words: lost, sweaty, cold, where Is free parking.", "created_time": "2017-06-29T01:20:57+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209575917981820", "status_type": "added_photos", "message": "This is a gym that has eight twenty foot pillars in front of it-- which is excessive.

I am currently enrolled in the school of Art and Design, but I am in the process of being put into the applicant pool for the school of Information, as their curriculum better suits my academic goals. So I may be dual majoring, or getting a single major. I don't really know all of that yet, I just know that Imma be in Ann Arbor this fall.\n\nI am going to miss Seattle's people, the mountains, and the diversity of the city so much. It has been a wild ride and I have met amazing people from all different walks of life. Everyone I have met has an interesting story to share, and I am humbled that so many different people have shared their stories with me. But this is not a goodbye, this is a \"see you soon\". I don't know what my future holds, but Seattle will always have a special place in my heart, and I defintley can see myself living here at a later stage of my life. \n\nLiving in Seattle has been an amazing experience that I am incredibly grateful for. Seeing LGBTQIA+ people living out and proudly is something that I never saw my entire 18 years of growing up in Rochester Hills. Simply seeing same-sex couples holding hands in a public is empowering and dignifies identities. Because of experiences like these, I have learned first hand how vital representation is for underrepresented communities. The Midwest has never been on the forefront of LGBTQIA+ rights, and I want to bring some of the good ol' west coast gayness back to the mitten. Mindsets can be/need to be changed, and I want the the next generation of queers to see that there are respected gay people out there, and they aren't only in big cities. \n\nSo see you soon Michigan friends and family :)", "created_time": "2017-04-29T20:19:12+0000"}, {"id": "10204494742955620_10209053826769866", "status_type": "mobile_status_update", "message": "I just completed 6 different essays that I thought were 1,000 WORD limits, but they were actually 1,000 CHARACTER limit essays.
