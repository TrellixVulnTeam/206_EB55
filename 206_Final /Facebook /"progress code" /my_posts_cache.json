{"message": "Ohhhh the ironies of the world. I have spent the last year stressing out about internships since a great number of my peers have been getting bomb ass internships across the globe. In the past week I have had four interviews for internship positions and I was actually offered one at a company called 500 startups. 700 people applied, 10 were interviewed, and I was offered the internship at the end of the cycle (omfg). BUT the catch is that it is an internship for the fall and I am going to be attending U of M so I am not able to accept it. \n\nBut for those of you that don't know, I drove down to San Francisco this summer to have a good time and to spend some time with Jared- who I have been dating for about 9ish months (I think it's okay to tag ya in a post now lol). I have only been in SF for ~4 weeks and I have been to 5 or 6 different events/summits/meetups. I will be driving from Cali to Michigan with my brother around August 18th. \n\nI came to SF not really knowing anyone besides Jared and his roommates, but I somehow got a job on the 5th day I was in the city after some hustling on the good ol' Linkedin and other job sites. Aaaaand it's another one of Kyle's weird jobs. My summer job this year is at a Korean Bibimbop restaurant. Which is essentially a Korean Chipotle. It is located in an international food court in the downtown financial district. Which I was a little bummed about at first- but since it is located where a bunch of fancy business people work AND eat lunch I am able to talk to them when they order food; so I have actually been able to make some valuable contacts with people in the same field I am-- while I am asking them if they would like noodles, rice or lettuce for their bowl of course. \n\nBut I'm excited (and a lil nervous) to see what my future holds in Ann Arbor this coming fall, and to see my Michigan people! \n\nThat's all I got for my Facebook update this time!", "created_time": "2017-07-14T17:50:36+0000", "id": "10204494742955620_10209753922831830"}

{"message": "For those of you that may not know, I am in San Francisco for the summer!! I finished my last quarter ever at North Seattle College this past Friday and I drove down to Portland on Saturday and then I drove down to San Francisco on Sunday! I don't have any fancy internship, but I kind of have a person down here that I like a lot, so I am having a fun time. I am currently applying to restaurant jobs and will probably be working by the end of this week.\n\nAt the end of the summer I am driving from SF to Ann Arbor with my brother Kevin (lolol) to start school at UMich. I am so so excited for this summer and to start school this fall! And I want to give a big ol' shout out to my parents Kim Buczek Essenmacher and Brian Essenmacher. They have been super supportive, and I would not have this amazing opportunity without them. My dad flew across the country and worked on my car on Fathers Day weekend, which is mind-bogglingly kind. And even though I sometimes get annoyed when my mom has the audacity to ask me about logistics of my crazy plans, such as driving from one corner to the US to another I appreciate her insights since she always has my best interest. \n\nSo if you're in the SF Bay Area this summer gimme a holler and we can get lost on the public transportation together! Or If ya wanna visit me feel free to send me a PM (I have an extra bedroom in my sublet!!).

{"message": "Hey o hey people that follow my life on the internet. So I know that I originally said that I was planning on attending Western Washington University this fall. BUT after some thinking and talks with the family, that is not going to happen anymore. I am going to be finishing my Bachelors Degree at the University of Michigan! I am currently enrolled in the school of Art and Design, but I am in the process of being put into the applicant pool for the school of Information, as their curriculum better suits my academic goals. So I may be dual majoring, or getting a single major. I don't really know all of that yet, I just know that Imma be in Ann Arbor this fall.\n\nI am going to miss Seattle's people, the mountains, and the diversity of the city so much. It has been a wild ride and I have met amazing people from all different walks of life. Everyone I have met has an interesting story to share, and I am humbled that so many different people have shared their stories with me. But this is not a goodbye, this is a \"see you soon\". I don't know what my future holds, but Seattle will always have a special place in my heart, and I defintley can see myself living here at a later stage of my life. \n\nLiving in Seattle has been an amazing experience that I am incredibly grateful for. Seeing LGBTQIA+ people living out and proudly is something that I never saw my entire 18 years of growing up in Rochester Hills. Simply seeing same-sex couples holding hands in a public is empowering and dignifies identities. Because of experiences like these, I have learned first hand how vital representation is for underrepresented communities. The Midwest has never been on the forefront of LGBTQIA+ rights, and I want to bring some of the good ol' west coast gayness back to the mitten. Mindsets can be/need to be changed, and I want the the next generation of queers to see that there are respected gay people out there, and they aren't only in big cities. \n\nSo see you soon Michigan friends and family :)", "created_time": "2017-04-29T20:19:12+0000", "id": "10204494742955620_10209076027324866"}

{"message": "I usually keep my mouth shut on facebook about political jargon but this current issue about the minimum wage is striking me closer to home than Cecil the Lion and other fb trends. \n\nI am in an interesting position at the moment. I Moved to Seattle last January and the minimum wage was $10ish/hour. The wage raised to $11/hour within two months of me being there and with a proposed raise to $15/hour this coming January. \n\nI know that I decided fully on my own to move to Seattle and decided to take a different college route than most students.  I went through the process of becoming a resident for a year and then pursuing the four year university path. With that decision comes the bearing of having to support yourself without the help of your parents. \n\nI started out working 30ish hours a week and having one class at a community college. initially this didn't seem too bad, because I had $3k in the bank that I saved up. I pretty much depleted through money within four months and before ya knew it, it was summer. This was when it hit me that I had to figure some shit out, and I had to fast. I kind of figured it out, and hey I'm still well enough to bitch on fb.\n\nAt 30 hours a week I made essentially $1200 a month and had rent at $850. I cannot imagine adding kids and bills into that mix which millions of Americans get landed into. Everyone makes bad choices, mistakes, etc.. (My parents helped me out when I was broke off my ass) That's life, but \n\n!!!!!\nit's not fair that privilege protects some while others get royally shafted. \n!!!!!\n\n(this is choppy, and I'm sorry but literally throw anything at me in the comments against raising the min wage and I'll rebound ya)", "created_time": "2015-11-15T05:07:25+0000", "id": "10204494742955620_10205205052152906"}

I haven't really updated in a while.\nI have been in Seattle for pretty much six months and oh my. \n\nI set the fire alarm off three times two off course past 1am.\n\nI got two new jobs and quit Sherwin Williams finally. One job at this fancy country club restaurant where the tips are huge, another at Urban Outfitters where the huge tips get huge discounts on clothes.\n\nI went to my first true club and me oh my. I was cat called for the first time and not a fan. No no no nope. There was a man that was creepily watching me dance/flail and my friend had to use the \"we're dating excuse\" to get him to leave. \n\nI have become increasingly more and more social justice-y which also means I am increasingly more and more less compassionate for ignorance. \n\nI guess I have stress induce eczema? which I fatally learned while I was working three jobs and going to school. It also spreads everywhere :) :) :)\n\nI have used my roadside assistance three times within 2 months all for dumb and preventable reasons which is embarrassing having both parents work for GM. I guess the stereotype of gays not being well with cars holds up. Sorry mom and dad :// I can match my clothes well though ;)\n\nI am a drunk crier I learned. Not even a happy crier. Invite me to your wedding and i'll kill the mood. Just watch. \n\nThis is all very vague and I'm forgetting a lot, but I am cooking chicken right now and need to make sure that I'm not setting off a fire alarm, so until next time.", "created_time": "2015-05-26T05:51:33+0000", "id": "10204494742955620_10204185047333423"}
