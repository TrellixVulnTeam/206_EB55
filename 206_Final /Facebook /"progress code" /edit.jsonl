 Story  over the summer I went to MoPop in chigan and all I had entering the festival s a regular ticket and my camera I nted to gain access to the  pit so I first joined a group of people ting VIP passes and acted like I s friends with them in line and got a VIP pass But I also needed a  pass to have access to  into the pit so I found another grapher ndering around and took a pic of his pass I then went home and make a replication of the pass on my puter I then went to Fed Ex and printed and lanated it This pass worked the majority of the festival until some lady caught me right before M came on and I s so upset But ay it s an awesome experience!
